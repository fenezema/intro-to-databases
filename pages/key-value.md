# NoSQL - Key-Value Database

## What is?
Key-value Database is another type of NoSQL database that basically pretty self explanatory from its name. Key-value Database store data in key-value manner, just like Python's Dictionary, Java Hashmap, Golang Map, etc. 

## Query Language
Well, in short, there are no particular query language for Key-Value Database. The simplest example would be DynamoDB or Redis. We can access the data we need using API, or, in DynamoDB case, they have other methods (PartiQL) that would look like SQL in syntax. <br>
While other DB like Redis (notable and famous for caching), only use API, and sometimes in some programming languages, has its own package that making things easy to query. Besides, the nature of Key-value Database would be how we use Python's Dictionary, Hashmap and others. We access the object via its key to get its value. Pretty straightforward.

## Tools
Again, no recommended tools for Key-value Database. Although, the like of Redis, has its own CLI, like `redis-cli` if you are a terminal guy that loves using terminal in every occasion. There are also the GUI app for Redis, like Redis Commander, Redsmin, and Regis Desktop Manager.

Others would be, like what has been mentioned before, TablePlus (again, not recommended on Linux and its derivatis. Beta version still lacks of features).
